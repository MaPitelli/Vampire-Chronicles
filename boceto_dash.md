- **Performance Optimization:** Given the large number of rows and columns, ensure that the data is optimized for Tableau by reducing unnecessary columns and possibly aggregating data where appropriate.

- **Interactivity:** Utilize Tableau's interactive features such as filters, tooltips, and dashboard actions to allow your client to explore the data dynamically.

- **Documentation:** Maintain clear documentation of each dashboard, explaining the purpose of each visualization and how to interpret the data.
